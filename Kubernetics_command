- apply vs create : https://www.containiq.com/post/kubectl-apply-vs-create
- kubectl exec is different from kubectl run, because it runs a command inside of an existing container, rather than spawning a new container for execution.
- kubectl run : Create and run a particular image, possibly replicated. Creates a deployment or job to manage the created container(s).
Create a pod
kubectl apply -f jupyter-anindya2.yaml
exec
kubectl exec -it jupyter-anindya2-7b8999bcff-4828k -- bash
Run
kubectl run anindya-shell --rm -it --image nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.02-py3 -- bash
#How to delete a pod
kubectl delete pods pod_name #if restart policy =Always a new pod will be restarted
To delete forcefully
kubectl delete -f jupyter-anindya2.yaml


To use jupyter and command prompt while mounting the path to container:

1. Create jupyter-anindya.yaml file

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jupyter-anindya2
  labels:
    k8s-app: jupyter-anindya2
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: jupyter-anindya2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: jupyter-anindya2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: jupyter-anindya2-container
        image: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.02-py3 
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        workingDir: /home01/anindya06.das
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8888
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /dev/shm
          name: dshm
        - mountPath: /home01/anindya06.das
          name: anindyahome
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        command: ["jupyter-notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0",  "--port=8888", "--allow-root"]
      volumes:
      - name: dshm
        emptyDir:
          medium: Memory
      - name: anindyahome
        hostPath:
        # directory location on host
          path: /home01/anindya06.das
          # this field is optional
          type: Directory
             
      restartPolicy: Always   
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: jupyter-anindya2
  name: jupyter-anindya2
spec:
  selector:
    k8s-app: jupyter-anindya2
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    nodePort: 30997


2. change host path, working directory path
3. kubectl create -f .\jupyter_anindya2.yaml
4.kubectl exec -it deploy/jupyter-anindya2 -- /bin/bash , to run in shell

kubectl delete pods <podid>
kubectl describe pod <podname>
to delete the entire pod
kubectl delete -f config.yaml

It will reserve GPUs for the user even if the process is not running. so nvidia-smi will show available pods, but reserve pods may not be available
to see how many pods have been allocated
go in side pod using exec do an nvidia-smi, it will show allocated gpus
to come out of the pod use ctrl+d or exit command
