chmod command

 - find . -ls
 
 find: This is the command used to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy.

.: This dot represents the current directory. It tells the "find" command to start its search from the current directory.

-ls: This option tells the "find" command to list detailed information about the found files and directories in a format similar to the Unix "ls" command. It displays file or directory information such as permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and last modification time.

 The string "drwx------" represents the permissions and file type of a directory in a Unix-like file system. Here's the breakdown:

1. **d**: This indicates that the entry is a directory. In Unix-like systems, different file types are represented by different characters. "d" specifically denotes a directory.

2. **rwx------**: These are the permission settings for the directory. They can be divided into three parts:

    - **Owner Permissions (rwx)**: The first three characters indicate the permissions for the owner of the directory. "r" stands for read, "w" stands for write, and "x" stands for execute. In this case, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions on the directory.
    
    - **Group Permissions (---)**: The next three characters represent the permissions for the group associated with the directory. In this case, they are all set to "-", indicating no permissions for the group.
    
    - **Others Permissions (---)**: The last three characters represent the permissions for others (users who are not the owner and not in the group associated with the directory). In this case, they are all set to "-", indicating no permissions for others.

So, "drwx------" means the entry is a directory, and the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others have no permissions.


 "chmod -Rc u+w foo"
 
 The command "chmod -Rc u+w foo" can be broken down as follows:

1. **chmod**: This is a command in Unix-like operating systems used to change the permissions of files or directories.

2. **-R**: This option stands for "recursive." It tells the "chmod" command to apply the permission changes recursively to all files and directories within the specified directory and its subdirectories. This means that permissions will be modified not only for the specified directory "foo" but also for all files and directories contained within "foo."

3. **-c**: This option stands for "changes." It instructs the "chmod" command to display a message only if it makes a change to the permissions of any file or directory. If no changes are made, no output is produced.

4. **u+w**: This specifies the permission change to be made. "u" refers to the user (owner) of the file or directory, and "+w" means to add write permission for the user. So, the command adds write permission for the owner of the files and directories.

5. **foo**: This is the name of the directory for which the permissions are being modified.

In summary, the command "chmod -Rc u+w foo" recursively adds write permission for the owner of all files and directories within the directory "foo," displaying a message for each change made.
